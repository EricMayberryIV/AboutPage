      <h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Eric A. Mayberry IV, and I originally hail from the great state of Texas. At
        sometime in my life, I have lived in or near the four largest cities in Texas; San Antonio,
        Dallas (Plano actually), Austin, and Houston. I have also lived in 5 other states; Illinois,
        California, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Florida. I am a former U.S. Navy Sailor <span>(FC2 (SW))
        </span>, a former Industrial Electrician, a current Programming student at <a href=
        "http://www.famu.edu/index.cfm?cis" target="_blank">Florida Agriculture &amp; Mechanical
        University</a> <span>(Computer Information Systems)</span>, and a current Program Liaison
        for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What is he looking to accomplish?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Well, I guess I should start with a bit of a back story as to how I ended up as a programming
        student at this stage in my life. I have always been attracted to computers and information
        technology. This goes back, in my mind, to when I used to type out the free programs that they
        use to print in the back of Commodore Magazine during the (very) late 80's. Then I suppose,
        around 1999, when my mother shipped out a WebTV to me, I taught myself how to do some redimentary
        HTML. Around that time I was learing a lot about repairing PC's and doing what I could to teach
        myself how to fix common issues with software.
        <br/><br/>
        I thought that it was all just a hobby. I guess
        I resisted because I believed that if you turned what you did as a hobby into a job, you
        would end up hating it. OH...MY...GOODNESS, I couldn't have been more WRONG! Let me tell you
        now, if you find something that you love and can make money at it, it is not a "job" at all. I
        mean, I get paid to do what I absolutely LOVE to do.
        <br/><br/>
        Alright, so how did I specifically end up on a programming path? Well, that has everything to
        do with the fact that I attempted to get an Engineering degree. Once I had graduated from the
        local community college (<a href="https://www.tcc.fl.edu/" target="_blank">TCC</a>), I
        enrolled at FAMU to persue my Engineering degree. That's when I was placed in my first
        official OOP class, and instantly fell in love with programming.
        <br/><br/>
        Since that first class, I have been doing what I can to expand my knowledge of as many programming
        techniques and languages as I can. For the time being, I have been focusing on honing my
        skills in HTML5 and CSS3, while also learning as much as I can about JavaScript&sup1;,
        JQuery&sup1;, Ruby&sup1;, ASP&sup2;, VBScript&sup2;, PHP, SQL, C&plus;&plus;, and Shell. My
        ultimate goal is to work, either for myself or for a major corporation, coding websites and/or
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>&sup1; Learning as I go, but it's a work in progress.<br/></small>
        <small>&sup2; Required for my current position.</small>
